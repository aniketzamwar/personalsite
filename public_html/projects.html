							<td>Emulated a time driven M/M/2 queuing system using POSIX Threads, Locks and Condition Variables to achieve thread synchronization.
							There is a single stream of customers arriving to the system according to a Poisson process with rate lambda. Customers are queued at Q1 and are served in first-in-first-out order. As server S1 or S2 becomes idle, 
							it removes the customer at the head of the queue and begins to serve the customer. The service time of a customer is Exponentially distributed with mean 1/mu. 
							The unit for both lambda and mu is (1/sec).</td>

				<h3>Detailed Description</h3>
				<span>
				The project consisted of two main parts. <br />For part (1), system was developed to handle join(to join network), hello(to send hello message before join for identification), keepalive(to keep checking the conenctivity to network), notify(to send disconnect message), check(to check network reachability), and status messages(to get information about all nodes connected to network and files each node in the SERVANT network stores), 
				as well as the formation of the SERVANT network and complete logging for the above message types. 
				<br />The only user commands a node must handle are the shutdown and the status neighbors commands.
				</br />For Part 2 we implement features like storing of file at specific node in network, searching of file in network, retrieving of file from network and deleting the file from network. Also, features like probability caching of file within intermediate nodes was implemented.  
				<br />Each node was identified with a unique UOID. Message caching was implemented and each message flowing accross the network was provided with TTL to avoid circulation of same message through the network. Also, each message was uniquely identified with Message ID dynamically generated using system time, hash algorithms.
				Each node consisted of a ini config file with startup configuration information like auto shutdown time, file caching probability, file store probability, TTL value, log file name, cache size to store file.
				<br /><span>Please contact me to know more about design aspects like <span class="special">Message Types, Message Format, Message Caching and Message Queue System, incoming and outgoing message logging, keyword search implementation </span> of the Project</span>
