									Project 1: Build a synchronized, multi-threaded system
									<!-- &#45; -->
								</h3>
								<p>
									<b><u>Description:</u></b> Implement locks and condition
									variables for NACHOS operating system. Movie Stimulation design
									and implementation with entities Customers, Manager, Ticket
									Clerks, Ticket Takers, Concession Clerk and Movie Technician
									interacting with each other and sharing information.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Domain:</u></b> System Development, C Programming
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Development Details:</u></b> Developed <span
										class="special">Synchronization</span> features to avoid <span
										class="special">deadlocks and race conditions</span> in a
									operating system. This was the first project to design and
									develop <span class="special"> locks and monitors. </span> And
									Movie Stimulation was implemented with different entities to
									test these features developed.
								</p>
						</li>

								<h3>
									Project 2. System Calls and Multiprogramming
									<!--&#45;-->
								</h3>
								<p>
									<b><u>Description:</u></b> This is an extension to the first
									project where system calls were developed to separate the movie
									stimulation from system and multi-programming was enabled
									inside the system. Movie Stimulation was separated from system
									and was given a system program view. The system calls which was
									the first part of this project was to map interfaces to system
									calls used in the movie stimulation. The system calls
									implemented were Creation, Deletion, Acquire, Release of Locks;
									Create, Delete, Wait, Signal and Broadcast system calls on
									Condition Variables. Also, other system calls were implemented
									for semaphores, Console Output.<br /> Second part was to
									implement memory allocation and paging of memory to enable
									multiprogramming. To enable this the <span class="special">segments
										of memory</span> were divided into <span class="special">pages</span>
									and the movie stimulation program was loaded in these pages. <span
										class="special">Fork and Exec system calls</span> were
									designed and coded where fork system call was used to fork new
									threads in user programs' memory space with new stack space
									allocation to the thread and exec was to execute new programs
									with a new memory pages allocation consisting of new executable
									code space and stack space.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Domain:</u></b> System Design, C Programming
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Development Details:</u></b> This project was to design
									and develop system calls to give the system a separate user
									program from the system. Second part was to design the memory
									pages, page size and allocation of pages for executable space
									and stack space for the application program. In this project we
									considered to have a infinite memory space and all the pages
									were loaded in one go, no demand paging was implemented.
								</p>
						</li>
							<li class="comment_even">
								<h3>
									Project 3: Virtual Memory
									<!-- &#45; -->
								</h3>
								<p>
									<b><u>Description:</u></b> Second project supports
									multiprograming with the use of Paging but the entire user
									program was loaded at one time. This first part of project was
									to implement <span class="special">Demand Paging,
										Virtual memory and Translation Lookaside Buffer</span>. The previous
									consideration of infinite memory was not anymore here and so
									limited pages were allocated to each user program and so <span
										class="special">page faults</span> had to be handled and
									page-in and page-out implementation was implemented. TLB and
									IBT structures were conceptually understood and programmed to
									enable demand paging and handle page fault exceptions in the
									system.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Domain:</u></b> System Development, C Programming
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Development Details:</u></b> The demand paging and TLB
									was implemented and movie stimulation was executed in this
									environment with each entity as a different user program. And
									success of working of movie stimulation as expected was checked
									to conclude the proper and correct design of <span
										class="special">demand paging and virtual memory</span>. Also,
									minute implementation of <span class="special">networking
										system calls</span> for distributed system was drafted and
									programmed.

								<h3>
									Project 4: Distributed Movie Theater
									<!-- &#45; -->
								</h3>
								<p>
									<b><u>Description:</u></b> Implementation of Distributed
									systems where all the system calls were implemented to work
									accross multiple servers. <span class="special">System
										calls</span> were modified and implemented for locks, condition
									varibles as well as monitor variables. The distributed system
									was designed to work with <span class="special">multiple
										servers and multiple clients and total ordering</span> was designed
									and developed to avoid inconsistency within resources needed by
									programs running on client machines.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Domain:</u></b> System Development, C Programming
								</p>
								<p>
									<b><u>Development Details:</u></b> Distributed system was
									developed and movie stimulation was implemented with different
									entities running as multiple clients running together using the
									resources like locks, MVs and CVs on different servers without
									any deadlock and inconsistency in resource allocation. <span
										class="special">Total ordering</span> was successfully
									implemented to avoid allocation of same resource on multiple
									servers used by different entities of the movie stimulation.
